<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>

<p>Hey there! I'm Zorro, a passionate software engineer with a knack for coding. My primary language is <strong>JavaScript</strong>, where I spend most of my time crafting innovative solutions. I also have experience in <strong>C#</strong>, diving into the exciting world of game development!</p>

<p>Though I still consider myself relatively new to programming with about <strong>4 years of experience</strong>, my enthusiasm knows no bounds! I thrive on solving challenging problems and find that the more complex the challenge, the more rewarding it becomes.</p>

<p>Thank you for stopping by to explore my work! If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out through my contact page. Happy browsing!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p><strong>Zorro</strong></p>
